* integrate unimodal into nelpy

* restrict minimum firing rate
* restrict to minimum number of cells
* remove empty bins
* linregress
* shuffle

* psth, isi, fano-factor, ... (easy and not important)

* rename decoding to ML
* singletons in EpochArray
* remove empty bins during regression, but not from the decoding itself
