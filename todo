[ ] pomegranate (at leat YAHMM) was [very] slow for me; but it still seems
    like a really nice package, with a clear goal, and super nice flexibility
    e.g. mixtures of HMMs, which would be awesome for hippocampal work.
    Maybe reconsider? http://pomegranate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html

[ ] append AnalogSignalArrays
[ ] re-write EpochArray merge
[ ] decouple EpochArray operations from merged (complement, duration, etc.)
[ ] remove auto-merge for contiguous arrays (what was Josh's use case?)
[ ] position linearization and idealization, given segments
[ ] recompute interpolant only if hash has changed (consider adding other things to memoization)
